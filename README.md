# Landing Pages

A Next.js workspace for building and testing idea validation landing pages with sophisticated design and user engagement flows.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run ESLint and auto-fix issues
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run check` - Run both typecheck and lint

## Structure

- `/app` - Next.js App Router pages
  - `/app/page.tsx` - Main homepage (blank placeholder)
  - `/app/[idea-name]/` - Individual landing pages for each idea
- `/lib` - Shared utilities
- `/components` - Shared components (use sparingly)

## Landing Page Design Standards

Based on our first landing page (estate-beacon), future landing pages should include:

### Required Sections

1. **Hero Section** with:
   - Rich, layered gradient backgrounds (not flat colors)
   - Radial blur effects and subtle patterns for depth
   - Logo + brand name + descriptive tagline badge
   - Large, bold headline (5xl-6xl) with clear value proposition
   - Supporting subheadline explaining the problem/solution
   - Single prominent CTA button
   - Optional: Corner/floating product screenshots showing real UI

2. **Problem/Solution Section**:
   - Side-by-side layout with text and product screenshot
   - Clear articulation of user pain points
   - Simple checklist or progress visualization

3. **Product Screenshots Section**:
   - 3+ alternating left/right feature showcases
   - Browser window mockups with realistic UI elements
   - Category badges for each feature
   - Feature benefit lists with checkmarks
   - Descriptive text explaining the value

4. **Features Grid**:
   - 6-9 features in responsive grid (2-3 columns)
   - Emoji or icon + title + description
   - Hover effects (lift, shadow, scale)

5. **How It Works**:
   - 3-step numbered process
   - Visual step indicators with gradient backgrounds
   - Connecting lines between steps (on desktop)

6. **FAQ Section**:
   - Collapsible accordion-style FAQs
   - Address common objections and concerns
   - Price transparency if applicable

7. **Questionnaire/Email Capture**:
   - Multi-step questionnaire (3-5 questions)
   - Progress bar for user engagement
   - Collect relevant segmentation data
   - Summary of user's answers
   - Email capture with clear value proposition
   - Success state confirmation

8. **Footer**:
   - Dark background for contrast
   - Logo + copyright + basic links

### Design Patterns

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Use size, weight, and color to guide attention
- **Gradients**: Multi-layered, sophisticated gradients (not simple linear)
- **Typography**: Mix of bold headlines (font-bold) and light body text (font-light)
- **Spacing**: Generous padding and margins for breathing room
- **Mockups**: Browser window chrome for product screenshots
- **Colors**: Establish a primary brand color and use consistently
- **Animations**: Subtle hover states and transitions
- **Trust Signals**: Professional mockups, clear pricing, social proof

### Technical Requirements

- **Metadata**: SEO-optimized title, description, and Open Graph tags
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
- **Components**: Extract reusable components (Questionnaire, FAQ, EmailForm)
- **Analytics**: gtag event tracking for conversions
- **Loading States**: Handle form submissions with proper feedback
- **Validation**: Email validation and error handling
